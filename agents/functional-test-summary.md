# Payment Agent Functional Test Summary

## What's Tested ‚úÖ

### Infrastructure Tests (`test-payment-agent.js`)
- ‚úÖ HTTP server is running on port 3002
- ‚úÖ MCP endpoints are accessible (/.well-known/agent.json, /sse)
- ‚úÖ RPC connection to Arbitrum Sepolia works
- ‚úÖ Can query blockchain data (latest block)
- ‚úÖ USDC and TokenMessenger contracts exist and respond

### Code Quality
- ‚úÖ TypeScript builds without errors
- ‚úÖ Follows Vibekit v2 patterns
- ‚úÖ MCP server structure is correct
- ‚úÖ Payment transaction data generation works

### Demo Scripts
- ‚úÖ `demo-payment-flow-interactive.js` - Shows transaction data generation
- ‚úÖ `send-payment-demo.js` - Sends actual USDC (but same-chain only)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  `integration-test.js` - Has MCP client compatibility issues

## What Requires Manual Testing üîß

### CCTP Cross-Chain Payment Detection
The Payment Agent listens for Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) events, specifically the `MintAndWithdraw` event that occurs when USDC is minted on the destination chain.

**Why same-chain transfers don't work:**
- CCTP uses a burn-and-mint mechanism
- Source chain: Burns USDC and emits event
- Circle: Attests the burn (30-60 seconds)
- Destination chain: Mints new USDC and emits `MintAndWithdraw`
- Payment Agent: Detects the mint event and distributes

**To test the full flow:**
1. Use the CCTP web app (http://localhost:3000)
2. Send USDC from another chain (e.g., Ethereum Sepolia) to Payment Agent on Arbitrum Sepolia
3. Wait for attestation and mint
4. Payment Agent should detect and auto-distribute

### Auto-Distribution Logic
- Requires Payment Agent to have USDC balance
- Requires funded wallet for gas fees
- Should split 60% to Scope, 40% to Coder
- Actual transaction execution untested

### End-to-End Flow
1. User sends CCTP payment from another chain
2. Payment Agent detects MintAndWithdraw event (1-second polling)
3. Calculates split amounts
4. Sends USDC to Scope and Coder agents
5. Logs success/failure

## Test Commands

```bash
# From /agents directory

# 1. Test infrastructure
node test-payment-agent.js

# 2. See transaction data generation (interactive)
node demo-payment-flow-interactive.js

# 3. Send same-chain USDC (won't trigger CCTP detection)
node send-payment-demo.js

# 4. For full CCTP test, use the web app:
# - Start all services: pnpm dev (from root)
# - Open http://localhost:3000
# - Send cross-chain USDC to Payment Agent address
```

## Known Limitations

1. **CCTP Detection**: Only works with cross-chain transfers, not same-chain
2. **Funding Required**: Need real testnet USDC and ETH for gas
3. **Attestation Time**: CCTP takes 30-60 seconds for Circle attestation
4. **MCP Integration**: Some compatibility issues with MCP client libraries

## Summary

The Payment Agent infrastructure is fully functional and ready for the hackathon demo. The core CCTP payment detection and auto-distribution logic is implemented but requires cross-chain transfers to test properly. For the hackathon, you can:

1. Demo the architecture and code
2. Show transaction data generation
3. Explain the CCTP burn-and-mint flow
4. Use the web app for live cross-chain demo (if funded)
