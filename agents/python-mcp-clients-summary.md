# Python MCP Client Implementations Summary

This directory contains the essential Python implementations for interacting with MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers using the official SDK.

## Available Implementations

### 1. **mcp_client_official_sse.py** âœ… (Core Implementation)
**Uses: Official MCP SDK with SSE transport**

This is the **core modular implementation** using the official MCP Python SDK (`pip install mcp`).

```python
from mcp import ClientSession
from mcp.client.sse import sse_client

async with MCPOfficialClient() as client:
    await client.connect_to_sse_server("http://localhost:3002/sse")
    result = await client.call_tool("payment-processing", {...})
```

**Features:**
- Official SDK support
- Clean async/await API
- Proper type safety with dataclasses
- Built-in SSE transport support
- Context manager for resource cleanup
- Fully modular and reusable

### 2. **seamless-payment-demo-official.py** ðŸŒŸ (Full Demo)
**Uses: Official MCP SDK + Web3 integration**

Complete Python implementation matching the TypeScript demo with all features:
- Verifies Payment Agent is running
- Creates payment request via MCP (starts listener)
- Includes Web3 setup for CCTP transfer
- Monitors for automatic distribution

```python
async with MCPOfficialClient() as client:
    await client.connect_to_sse_server("http://localhost:3002/sse")
    # Full payment flow with blockchain integration
```

**Features:**
- Complete end-to-end demo
- Shows real-world usage patterns
- Includes the modular MCP client (clearly marked for reuse)
- Blockchain integration setup with Web3.py
- Comprehensive error handling

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install mcp aiohttp python-dotenv
   # For full demo: pip install web3 eth-utils
   ```

2. **Run the official client example:**
   ```bash
   python mcp_client_official_sse.py
   ```

3. **Run the full demo:**
   ```bash
   python seamless-payment-demo-official.py
   ```

## Which File Should You Use?

- **For integration into your project**: Copy the `MCPOfficialClient` class from either file
- **For learning/testing**: Run `seamless-payment-demo-official.py` for a complete example
- **For minimal usage**: Use `mcp_client_official_sse.py` as a reference

## Example: Using the Modular Client

The `MCPOfficialClient` class is designed to be easily copied and reused:

```python
# Copy the MCPOfficialClient class from either file
from your_module import MCPOfficialClient

async def interact_with_mcp_server():
    async with MCPOfficialClient() as client:
        # Connect to any MCP server with SSE transport
        await client.connect_to_sse_server("http://your-server/sse")
        
        # List available tools
        tools = await client.list_tools()
        for tool in tools:
            print(f"Tool: {tool.name} - {tool.description}")
        
        # Call a tool
        result = await client.call_tool("your-tool", {
            "param1": "value1",
            "param2": "value2"
        })
        
        print(f"Result: {result}")

# Run it
asyncio.run(interact_with_mcp_server())
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Official SDK**: Uses the official MCP Python SDK maintained by Anthropic
2. **Type Safety**: Full type hints with dataclasses for better IDE support
3. **Async/Await**: Modern Python async patterns for better performance
4. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup with context managers
5. **Modular Design**: Easy to extract and use in other projects
6. **Real Examples**: Working code tested with actual MCP servers

## Notes

- The Payment Agent uses the Arbitrum Vibekit framework that implements MCP over HTTP/SSE
- Standard MCP typically uses stdio (subprocess) communication
- The official MCP SDK supports both transports seamlessly
- All implementations are async/await based using asyncio
- The modular client works with any MCP server that supports SSE transport
