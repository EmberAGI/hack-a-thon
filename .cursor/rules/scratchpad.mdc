# Project: Multi-Agent ENS Integration (Hackathon)

Current Role: Executor

## Background and Motivation
**HACKATHON PROJECT**: This is a proof-of-concept for a hackathon. We prioritize working demos over production-ready code, avoiding edge cases and complex error handling. No unit tests - manual testing only.

Building on the completed Payment Agent, we need to integrate ENS (Ethereum Name Service) names to make the system more user-friendly. Each agent will have its own ENS subdomain under `.agentshawarma.eth`:
- Coder Agent: `builder.agentshawarma.eth`
- Payment Agent: `payments.agentshawarma.eth`
- Scope Agent: `planner.agentshawarma.eth`

Additionally, the payment agent should construct a URL instead of a transaction, including amount and ENS parameters, with the domain coming from an environment variable.

**Existing Infrastructure**:
- Payment Agent: Fully functional with CCTP detection and auto-distribution
- Wallet addresses already generated:
  - Payment Agent: 0xDd418eC7d4AfF6d199ACd537e962664f34c9F7c7
  - Scope Agent: 0x3F9032f96A64F3396FdFEEe3f26B798B1a11b65
  - Coder Agent: 0x3BE92Fe06409096711087280CD6661854Ca4724E
- Coder/Scope Agents: Currently placeholders
- Demo scripts: 
  - `test-distribution-direct.js` - Tests distribution logic directly
  - `seamless-payment-demo.js` - Full end-to-end CCTP flow with auto-distribution

## Key Challenges and Analysis (Simplified for Hackathon)
1. **ENS Resolution**: Basic ENS resolution using viem - assume happy path
2. **Code Refactoring**: Quick find/replace of addresses with ENS resolution
3. **URL Construction**: Simple string formatting for payment URLs
4. **Environment Configuration**: Add ENS names to existing .env files
5. **Mock Agents**: Simple implementation for Coder agent only (Scope agent not needed)

**Hackathon Simplifications**:
- No complex error handling - assume ENS always resolves
- No caching - direct resolution each time (simpler code)
- No extensive testing - manual verification only
- Focus on demo flow, not edge cases

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
**2025-01-05T14:30:00Z - Planning Phase**
- Updated plan for hackathon approach
- Simplified all tasks for quick implementation
- Removed unnecessary complexity (caching, extensive error handling)
- Removed Scope Agent implementation (not needed)
- Clarified to update existing demo scripts (2 scripts, not 3)
- Corrected script names to match actual files

**2025-01-05T14:45:00Z - Execution Phase**
- ✅ Completed Task 1: ENS resolution implemented inline (simpler than shared module)
- ✅ Completed Task 2: Added ENS names and URL domain to payment agent .env files
- ✅ Completed Task 3: Refactored payment agent to generate URLs instead of transactions
- ✅ Completed Task 5: Distribution logic now shows ENS names alongside addresses
- ✅ Completed Task 6.1 & 6.2: Updated both demo scripts to display ENS names
- Task 4 (Coder Agent) not needed per user clarification
- Ready for testing the complete ENS integration

**2025-01-05T14:50:00Z - Testing Phase**
- **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: ENS is not supported on Arbitrum Sepolia
- Error: "Chain 'Arbitrum Sepolia' does not support contract 'ensUniversalResolver'"
- This explains why ENS resolution fails silently in our scripts
- **Hackathon Solution**: Display ENS names as labels alongside addresses
- No actual resolution needed - just show "payments.agentshawarma.eth (0xDd418...)"
- This gives the user-friendly experience without requiring ENS infrastructure

**2025-01-05T15:00:00Z - ENS Resolution Implementation**
- ✅ Updated payment agent to use Ethereum Sepolia for ENS resolution
- ✅ Updated demo scripts to use Ethereum Sepolia for ENS resolution
- ✅ Successfully rebuilt and restarted payment agent
- ✅ Distribution script runs successfully
- ❓ ENS names not appearing in output - need to verify if names are registered on Ethereum Sepolia
- Next step: Test the payment agent tool directly to see ENS resolution logs

**2025-01-05T15:10:00Z - Project Complete for Hackathon**
- ✅ Verified ENS names are NOT registered on Ethereum Sepolia
- ✅ System gracefully falls back to hardcoded addresses
- ✅ ENS names appear in all user-facing messages
- ✅ Payment and distribution functionality works perfectly
- ✅ Both demo scripts tested and working:
  - `test-distribution-direct.js` - Direct distribution test
  - `seamless-payment-demo.js` - Full CCTP flow with auto-distribution

**Hackathon Demo Ready:**
- Payment Agent generates URLs with ENS names
- System displays "payments.agentshawarma.eth" in messages
- Automatic distribution works flawlessly
- To fully enable ENS: Register the names on Ethereum Sepolia

**2025-01-05T15:20:00Z - ENS Integration Finalized**
- ✅ Updated to use Ethereum Mainnet for ENS resolution (cross-chain)
- ✅ ENS names ARE registered on mainnet and resolve correctly:
  - payments.agentshawarma.eth → 0xDd418eC7d4AfF6d199ACd537e962664f34c9F7c7
  - planner.agentshawarma.eth → 0x3F9032f96A64F3396FdFEEEe3f26B798B1a11b65
  - builder.agentshawarma.eth → 0x3BE92Fe06409096711087280CD6661854Ca4724E
- ✅ Updated demo script to display payment URL and details from agent response
- ✅ Full ENS integration working across all components

**Final Demo Features:**
- Cross-chain ENS resolution (mainnet → any EVM chain)
- Payment URL generation with ENS names
- Automatic fund distribution with ENS display
- Complete user-friendly experience with .eth names

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
N/A - Planning phase

## Lessons Learned
- From Payment Agent: Direct implementation without abstractions works well for hackathons
- From Payment Agent: Mock handlers effectively demonstrate capabilities
- From Payment Agent: Focus on working demos over comprehensive error handling
- ENS resolution with viem is straightforward - use getEnsAddress()
- URL-based approach is simpler than transaction generation
- Reuse existing demo scripts rather than creating new ones
- Verify file existence before including in plans
- ENS resolution requires actual registration on the blockchain
- Ethereum Sepolia supports ENS while Arbitrum Sepolia does not
- Graceful fallback mechanisms are essential for hackathon demos
- Cross-chain ENS resolution works well (resolve on Ethereum, use on Arbitrum)
- Always display tool responses in demo scripts for visibility
- ENS names on mainnet can be used across all EVM chains

## Rationale Log
- **Decision:** Use viem's getEnsAddress() directly without wrapper
  **Rationale:** Simpler for hackathon, viem already handles the complexity
  **Trade-offs:** No custom error handling, but fine for demo
  **Date:** 2025-01-05

- **Decision:** No caching for ENS lookups
  **Rationale:** Simpler code, acceptable for low-volume hackathon demo
  **Trade-offs:** More RPC calls, but negligible for demo
  **Date:** 2025-01-05

- **Decision:** Inline ENS resolution instead of shared module
  **Rationale:** Faster to implement, less setup required
  **Trade-offs:** Some code duplication, but minimal for 3 agents
  **Date:** 2025-01-05

- **Decision:** Basic mock implementation for Coder agent only
  **Rationale:** Focus on ENS integration demo, Scope agent not needed
  **Trade-offs:** Less complete system, but faster to implement
  **Date:** 2025-01-05

- **Decision:** Manual testing only
  **Rationale:** Hackathon time constraints, same approach as Payment Agent
  **Trade-offs:** No automated verification, but fine for one-time demo
  **Date:** 2025-01-05

- **Decision:** Update existing demo scripts instead of creating new ones
  **Rationale:** Scripts already work well, just need ENS display added
  **Trade-offs:** None - this is purely beneficial
  **Date:** 2025-01-05
