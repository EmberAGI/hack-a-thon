# Project: Multi-Agent Development Workflow - Scope & Coder Agents

Current Role: Planner

## Background and Motivation
**HACKATHON PROJECT - Phase 2**: Building on the completed Payment Agent, we now need to create the Scope and Coder agents. These agents will complete the multi-agent development workflow where:
1. **Scope Agent**: Builds development scope and plans for applications
2. **Coder Agent**: Implements the scope passed to it and deploys working applications
3. **Payment Agent**: (Already complete) Handles payment distribution

**Key Constraint**: Like the Payment Agent, both Scope and Coder agents will NOT contain LLMs - they will have mock handler tools for now.

## Previous Work Summary (from Phase 1)
- **Completed**: Payment Agent with CCTP mint detection and automatic fund distribution
- **Wallet Infrastructure**: Three EOA wallets generated:
  - Scope Agent: 0x3F9032f96A64F3396FdFEEe3f26B798B1a11b65
  - Payment Agent: 0xDd418eC7d4AfF6d199ACd537e962664f34c9F7c7
  - Coder Agent: 0x3BE92Fe06409096711087280CD6661854Ca4724E
- **Architecture**: Vibekit v2 framework, MCP servers, no unit tests (hackathon approach)
- **Location**: All agents in `/agents/` directory

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- **Mock Implementations**: Since no LLMs, need realistic mock responses that demonstrate capabilities
- **Tool Design**: Create tools that represent the agents' intended functionality
- **Descriptions**: Ensure both agents have appropriate descriptions for their purpose
- **Integration Points**: Consider how these agents would interact in a real workflow

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Scope Agent Implementation
- Description: Create Scope Agent with tools for building development scopes and plans
- Success Criteria: 
  - Agent starts with `pnpm dev`
  - Has appropriate skill descriptions
  - Mock tools return realistic scope/plan responses
- Dependencies: None (can work in parallel with Task 2)
- Status: Not Started

### Task 2: Coder Agent Implementation  
- Description: Create Coder Agent with tools for implementing development tasks
- Success Criteria:
  - Agent starts with `pnpm dev`
  - Has appropriate skill descriptions
  - Mock tools simulate code generation and deployment
- Dependencies: None (can work in parallel with Task 1)
- Status: Not Started

### Task 3: Integration Testing
- Description: Test all three agents together in a simulated workflow
- Success Criteria: Can demonstrate end-to-end flow for judges
- Dependencies: Tasks 1 & 2
- Status: Not Started

## Project Status Board
- [ ] 1.1: Create Scope Agent basic structure (index.ts, package.json)
- [ ] 1.2: Implement scope-building skill with mock tools
- [ ] 1.3: Add realistic mock responses for scope generation
- [ ] 2.1: Create Coder Agent basic structure (index.ts, package.json)
- [ ] 2.2: Implement code-development skill with mock tools  
- [ ] 2.3: Add realistic mock responses for code generation
- [ ] 3.1: Create integration demo script
- [ ] 3.2: Document the complete workflow

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
**2025-01-05T01:20:00Z - Planning Phase**
- Created new scratchpad for Phase 2
- Previous Payment Agent work archived in scratchpad-v1-payment-agent.mdc
- Ready to begin implementation of Scope and Coder agents

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
N/A - Planning phase

## Lessons Learned
- **From Phase 1**: Direct tool implementations without LLMs work well for demos
- **From Phase 1**: Mock handlers can effectively demonstrate agent capabilities
- **From Phase 1**: Focus on working demos over comprehensive error handling

## Rationale Log
- **Decision:** Create agents without LLMs using mock handlers
  **Rationale:** Consistent with Payment Agent approach, simpler for hackathon, demonstrates architecture without AI complexity
  **Trade-offs:** Less dynamic than real AI agents, but perfect for demonstrating multi-agent workflow
  **Date:** 2025-01-05

- **Decision:** Implement Scope and Coder agents in parallel
  **Rationale:** No dependencies between them, faster development, can split work if needed
  **Trade-offs:** Might need minor adjustments for integration, but minimal risk
